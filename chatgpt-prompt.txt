Hi ChatGPT, I’m working on a flight delay prediction project called DelayOver. Here’s a summary to bring you up to speed:
Project goal: Predict flight delays (e.g., delay > 15 minutes) based on data available at booking time.
Data sources:
BTS On-Time Performance data downloaded monthly (rolling 3 months).
5% Cancellations dataset (auto-downloaded, smaller and updated more frequently).
Tech stack & workflow:
Data ingestion script downloads latest BTS zip files, extracts, converts to Parquet.
Data cleaning and feature engineering in Pandas, including date features, origin/destination airports, airline, holiday proximity indicators, etc.
Model training uses a rolling 3-month dataset.
Streamlit app for demo & user input; Docker for containerization and deployment.
Folder structure:
data/raw/ — raw downloaded data and extracted CSVs/parquets
notebooks/ — exploratory Jupyter notebooks
scripts/ — ingestion, cleaning, and other utilities
models/ — saved models and training scripts
app.py or similar — Streamlit deployment app
Recent additions:
Holiday features: numeric “days to nearest holiday” + categorical holiday type
Handling missing or NaN columns, rolling 3-month data window
Current issues or focus areas:
Ensuring reliable BTS data ingestion with backfill logic
Data cleaning pipelines for ML readiness
Feature engineering around flight date, airports, airline, holidays
Planning Streamlit app structure for both exploratory data querying and ML predictions
